This repository contains type definition files for Toon Boom Harmony and Storyboard Pro.

These definitions were parsed from the official API documentation, but have been modified where the documentation was lacking.

To use these types, you must specify a reference type in your Typescript document.

```typescript
/// <reference types="tba-types/Harmony/15"/>
```

```typescript
/// <reference types="tba-types/StoryboardPro/5"/>
```

It is important to omit `DOM` from your `lib` section of your `tsconfig.json` file.  Otherwise, there will be a naming conflict between Toon Boom's `File` object and the DOM `File` object.

For example:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "target": "es5",
    "lib": ["es5"],
    ...
  }
}
```

The code generated by Typescript will work in Toon Boom with the above settings.  However, there is one more tweak you have to do to get the scripts to execute.  When Typescript generates the `.js` files, it adds a line to the top like:

```javascript
Object.defineProperty(exports, "__esModule", { value: true });
```

This line will cause Toon Boom to fail to execute the script.  You can either remove it yourself, or add a task to your build pipeline to remove it.  In my case, I use gulp.  My main gulp task is setup like this:


```javascript
var gulp = require("gulp");
var ts = require("gulp-typescript");
var tsProject = ts.createProject("tsconfig.json");
var replace = require('gulp-replace');

gulp.task("ts", function () {
    return tsProject.src()
        .pipe(tsProject())
        .js
        .pipe(replace(/Object.defineProperty\(exports.+\n/, ""))
        .pipe(gulp.dest("dist"));
});
```

If you have a better solution to deal with this, please let me know!
